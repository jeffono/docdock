# Plan

Each task indicates the model level (see `AGENTS.md`). Mark `[x]` in the commit that completes it and
detail each stage when it is next.

## In progress

## Completed

- M0 — Panel proven and approved with Tauri; see `docs/decisions/0003-panel-and-web-pages.md`.
- M1 — Browse markdown notes, tray, global shortcut, CSP and visual identity; see `docs/DESIGN.md`.
- M2 — Create and edit: atomic autosave, external changes, leftover recovery, frontmatter, editor and
  pasted images.
- M2.1 — Editor polish: save robustness, live formatting, editor chrome and one Markdown parser for
  both views; see `docs/decisions/0007-one-markdown-parser.md`.
- M3 — Find and pin: content search, unified bar, pinned cards and note rows, in-place editing, focused
  panel and list keyboard; see "Note list" in `docs/DESIGN.md` and `docs/decisions/0005-pinned-items.md`.
- M4 — Web pages: mobile browser tab with history and suggestions, page selection read from Rust,
  pages saved as notes, code colors and Edge features filtered; see "Untrusted content" in
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- M4.1 — Preferences: gear view, saved panel width, note order and date grouping, pinned reorder by
  drag or keyboard, and list polish; see "Preferences" and "Note list" in `docs/DESIGN.md`.
- M4.2 — Files: renaming from the card title, automatic names, file names beside differing titles,
  frontmatter completion and Ctrl+;, folder prefixes and grouping; see "Note list" in `docs/DESIGN.md`.
- M4.3 — Editor: find and replace in the note, several cursors, formatting bar, shortcut sheet on
  Ctrl+/, bracket pairing, tag repair on leaving and theme choice; see the editor section of
  `docs/DESIGN.md`.
- M4.4 — Move and delete: card menu, notes to the Recycle Bin with undo while the panel is open,
  moving through a folder picker with relative links rewritten, and folder deletion from group labels;
  see "Note list" in `docs/DESIGN.md` and "Notes" in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- M5 — Distribute: README in English and pt-BR, MIT license, per-user NSIS installer, signed automatic
  updates from GitHub Releases, release workflow and quoted autostart path; see
  `docs/decisions/0008-distribution.md`.
- M6 — Panel adjustments: search and expanded note persist, pinned panel releases focus, Ctrl+, and
  Ctrl+Shift+D, Start with Windows and a custom activation shortcut; see "Note list", "Preferences"
  and "Panel navigation" in `docs/DESIGN.md`.
- Release 0.1.0-beta.2: automatic update from 0.1.0-beta.1 validated.
- M7 — Versatile search: optional relative dates, `#tag` and `date:` filters with completion, tags
  seeded on creation and web actions as a list section; see "Note list" in `docs/DESIGN.md` and
  "Notes" in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Frontend tests grew 32%, mostly pure parser and date-range cases.
- M8 — Note privacy: decision 0009, vault-friendly unavailable folder with a `.docdock/folder-id`
  marker, derived data inside the notes folder, a 30-day trash inside the folder where the Recycle Bin
  refuses (Preferences > Trash), deletes without confirmation and an Undo notice that draws attention,
  capture exclusion, private clipboard and an Unlock action for a Cryptomator vault file; see "Notes" in
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Rust tests grew 33%, on content loss and link safety around the folder marker,
  the unavailable folder and the trash.
- Release 0.1.0-beta.3: automatic update from 0.1.0-beta.2 validated.
- M9 — Clean pages: balanced tracking prevention on the page profile, content blocking with Brave's
  `adblock` crate from downloaded lists with cosmetic hiding and no scriptlets (about 8 MB), a shield to
  allow a site, and a reader view that extracts the article with `dom_smoothie` and saves it as a note;
  see `docs/decisions/0010-content-blocking.md`, `docs/decisions/0011-reader-view.md` and "Untrusted
  content" in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. The page window reaches no command from any origin and keeps
  native dialogs (`rfd` replaced `tauri-plugin-dialog`). Site permissions are asked in the panel and
  remembered per site; see `docs/decisions/0012-site-permissions.md`. Rust tests grew 23%, on site
  matching, the engine cache, reader bounds, early hiding state, page IPC and permission requests.
- Release 0.2.0: first SemVer version; automatic update from 0.1.0-beta.3 validated.

## Later

In no defined order:

- MathML equations with Temml; KaTeX depends on inline styling, blocked by CSP.
- Mermaid diagrams: require a decision on CSP, which blocks the `<style>` it injects.
- Slash commands in the editor, including "Add property" for the frontmatter.
- Post-its as floating desktop windows.
- Screenshots.
- Dictation with local models, downloaded separately from the installer.
- Plugins: require a recorded decision before starting.
- Privacy deterrents, not encryption: Windows Hello to show notes after the panel has been hidden for a
  while, and notes marked private in the frontmatter shown blurred until revealed.
- Code signing, free options (see `docs/decisions/0008-distribution.md`): SignPath Foundation once the
  project has verifiable reputation, which shows SignPath Foundation as publisher; or the Microsoft
  Store with a free individual account, which signs only MSIX packages. Tauri does not build MSIX, so
  the Store means a second channel without our updater, autostart through a package `StartupTask`
  instead of `Run`, offline WebView2 and testing the panel packaged. A paid Store edition for
  convenience is a possible revenue model while the code stays MIT.
- macOS and Linux: new `platform/` implementation. On Wayland, the panel depends on layer-shell, which
  GNOME does not provide.
